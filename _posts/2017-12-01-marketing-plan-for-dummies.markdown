<p>Taking up small projects is always refreshing. It provides you a chance to look at things differently.</p>
<p>I recently did a project on marketing an automation tool. Following is the problem statement and my take on what and how they should do it.</p>

**Problem Statement** <br/>
Keeping up with the demands to deliver the right content to the right people, the right place and at the right time, is
creating a huge strain on content processes within organizations already wrestling to reduce costs.
A content automation solution say autoMate helps global organizations streamline their content processes, enabling them to
deliver business-critical content with precision.

*What will it help you od?*
+ Manage content by streamlining the content review to approval process.
+ Automatically assemble the content for the right media and audience, including text styling, table assembly, dynamic chart creation and insertion of the required legal text.

Chalk the Segmentation and Target market for autoMate, along with mentioning the value proposition for such a
product. Make a marketing plan for a quarter and explain any one marketing channel in detail, mentioning the cost and ROI.
